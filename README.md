# wavEditing

This program reads, writes to, and manipulates digital audio files, specifically .WAV files. This was an assignment from one of my classes in C. It was an exercise in reading and writing data in specififed formats, using standard library functions for binary file I/O, and manipulating data in arrays.

The only code that I contributed to this is inside of audio.c, the rest was testcode provided to me. 

I do not give my permission for any of this code to be used, as it was done as a learning exercise and doing so would be plagiarism. If you would like permission to use it, message me directly. I would suggest learning about .WAV file interactions on your own, as it is a very interesting topic.
