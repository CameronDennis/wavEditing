# wavEditing

This program reads, writes to, and manipulates digital audio files, specifically .WAV files. This was an assignment from one of my classes in C. It was an exercise in reading and writing data in specififed formats, using standard library functions for binary file I/O, and manipulating data in arrays.


I do not give my permission for any of this code to be used, as it was done as a learning exercise and doing so would be plagiarism. If you would like permission to use it, message me directly.
